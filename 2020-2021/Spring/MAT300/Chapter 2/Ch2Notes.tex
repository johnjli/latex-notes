    \section{Quantifiers}

    $\forall x \, P(x)$ reads: "For all $x$, $P(x)$." This symbol is called the \emph{universal quantifier}
    because the statement states that P(x) is universally true. This statement is saying that the
    truth set of $P(x)$ is equal to $U$.

    $\exists x \, P(x)$ reads: "There exists an $x$ such that $P(x)$." This symbol is called the
    \emph{existential quantifier}. $P(x)$ is true for at least one value of $x$.

    The quantifiers \emph{binds} a variable. So $x$ is a bound variable in the statements
    $\forall x \, P(x)$ and $\exists x \, P(x)$.

    \subsection{Example}

    What do the following formulas mean? Are they true or false?

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\forall x \, (x^2 \geq 0) \in \mathbb{R}$
        \item $\exists x \, (x^2 - 2x + 3 = 0) \in \mathbb{R}$
        \item $\exists x \, (M(x) \land B(x))$ where the universe is the set of all people.
            $M(x)$ stands for: "$x$ is a man," and $B(x)$ stands for: "$x$ has brown hair."
        \item $\forall x \, (M(x) \rightarrow B(x))$ with same universe and definition as $3.$
        \item $\forall x \, L(x,y)$ where the universe is the set of all people,
            and $L(x,y)$ means "x likes y."
    \end{enumerate}

    \subsubsection*{Solutions}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item true
        \item true
        \item true
        \item false
        \item not enough information
    \end{enumerate}

    \subsection{Example}

    Analyze the logical forms of the following statements.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Someone didn't do the homework
        \item Everything in that store is either overpriced or poorly made
        \item Nobody's perfect
        \item Susan likes everyone who dislikes Joe
        \item $A \subseteq B$
        \item $A \cap B \subseteq B \setminus C$
    \end{enumerate}

    \subsubsection*{Solutions}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\exists x$ ($x$ didn't do the hw)
        \item $\forall x$ ((x in the store) $\rightarrow$ ((x is overpriced) $\lor$ (x is poorly made))
        \item $\neg \exists x$ (x is perfect)
        \item 
        \item not enough information
    \end{enumerate}
