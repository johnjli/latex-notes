# Notes for All my Classes

These are the notes I've taken and will take during my time at college as a computer science and math major. Hopefully this will help you as much as it has helped me.

## Class descriptions

Since these classes are at ASU, I've included a class description table for those who are taking classes outside of ASU.

| Class Name | Class Description |
| --- | --- |
| CSE 120 | Intro to logic design |
| MAT 300 | Mathematical structure |
